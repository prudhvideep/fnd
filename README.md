`fnd` is a versatile, intuitive file search utility for both local and remote environments. Inspired by [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd), this tool builds on fdâ€™s functionality by adding remote search capabilities, making it particularly useful for locating container logs or analyzing distributed file structures.

## Features

- **Simple, intuitive syntax**: Search effortlessly with `regex` or `glob` patterns.
- **Local & remote search**: Go beyond the local file system to locate files on remote servers.
- **Flexible pattern support**: Supports both `regex` and `glob` styles for versatile searching.
